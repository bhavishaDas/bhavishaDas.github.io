      What is Neuroplasticity?
    </h2>
    <p class="google-fonts-playball algin-center" style="font-size: 25px;">
      Neuroplasticity is the ability to rewire our brain. Our brain changes
      throughout our lives and it allows us to adapt, learn and even recover.
      When we learn the brain forms new pathways. Each new lesson has the
      potential to connect new neurons and change our brain’s way of thinking.
      <br />
      Understanding the principles of Neuroplasticity is beneficial for people
      from different walks of life. Someone who might have suffered from a brain
      stroke might recover using Neuroplasticity. Another benefit of practicing
      Neuroplasticity is that it enhances the learning capabilities of
      individuals.
      <br />
      Some ways to increase your neuroplasticity is to keep learning and
      practising as it strengthens the brain. Another important element would be
      to get enough sleep as your brain needs to reset failing to do this
      impairs your memory.
      <br />
      Neuroplasticity will be beneficial for me because I’m attempting to learn
      something new.

    <h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">What is Growth Mindset?</h2>
    <p class="google-fonts-playball algin-center" style="font-size: 25px;">
      Growth mindset is being able to change the way one thinks. Glass half full
      rather than glass half empty vibe. People with growth mindset tend to
      believe that with hard work and practice they can improve their skills.
      Developing a growth mindset helps in keeping a positive attitude. <br />
