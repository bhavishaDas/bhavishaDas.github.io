			What is Emotional intelligence?
		</h2>
		<p class="google-fonts-playball algin-center"  style="font-size: 25px;"">
			EQ is having social skills, empathy and self-awareness. It’s the ability
			to understand and manage your own emotions and the emotions of the people
			around you.
		</p>
		<br />
		<h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">
			How is it different to IQ?
		</h2>
		<p class="google-fonts-playball algin-center"  style="font-size: 25px;">
			EQ stands for emotional quotient, and it refers to one's emotions whereas
			IQ is measuring one’s academic intelligence by a test. EQ and IQ are the
			difference between being able to function well and being able to function
			well enough to succeed.
		</p>
		<br />
		<h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">
			Why is it important?
		</h2>
		<p class="google-fonts-playball algin-center"  style="font-size: 25px;">
			Having a high IQ is an advantage but if you don't have any EQ you won't be
			able to relate to others and wont have the ability to empathise. Having an
			EQ can make all the difference to your future career as nobody would want
			to work alongside somebody that comes across as self centered or can’t
			control their emotions.
