      Core Personal Values
    </h2>
    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
      One of my core values is work ethic and being honest to the work I
      undertake. I really don't appriciate when people don't follow up with
      their commitments. <br />

      When the lockdown started, we in the team knew that we will be made
      redundant soon. Before that though, we had a heap of bookings which were
      supposed to be cancelled. Being in sales, cancelled bookings meant losing
      on a heap of money along with the redundancy looming. <br />

      I had a to make a decision. It was either to sit at home and enjoy the
      wage subsidy knowing that I was close to loosing my job
      <strong>OR</strong> front up the harsh reality and get the work done<br />

      I chose the later and it felt right. Didn't make a change in my paycheck
      but I felt I had done the right thing. <br />

      I feel that this comes from growing up in a household where I have seen
      everyone hustle. I feel greatful to have grown up in an atomosphere where
      hardwork is recognised.

      Strengths and Limitations.
    </h2>
    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
      My strengths are that I have the ability to understand complex problems
      once I take a step back. I also have a good work ethic and my previous
      role as a Travel Consultant has conditioned me well for multimasking.
      Being in the sales industry, I have good communication skills and have
      extensive experience in managing stakeholder/client expectations. <br />
      I tend to get flustered and panicked when I am confronted with a problem
      which is hard to solve. I am aware that as a software developer, I will
      come across a zillion problems I wonâ€™t have an answer to. This course is
      actually helping me realise that if I take a step back, things fall into
      pieces. I also lack confidence - especially while I am doing this course.
      Self doubt creeps in from time to time which is a bummer.
      <br />
      I believe that my ability to perform in high pressure situations will help
      me in my journey in becoming a software developer. I do feel like I need
      to work on not getting flustered and breaking down the problem into
      smaller chunks and go step by step. I have started to use toggl more
      effectively now, regular breaks do help a lot. <br />
      Back in my previous role, I was working in a tight knit team and eveything
      was going great. One of my teammates got promoted to a team lead role. We
      all were super happy for them! With time, they started micro-managing
      everyone. All bookings needed their approval (which was never the case
      with the previous TL.) Five people in the team quit, it wasn't a good
      time. I had a 1:1 with them and highlighted what the issue was - they did
      acknowledge the problem which was refreshing. We started having regular
      catch-ups and they asked for constructive feedback. <br />

      Eventually things went back to normal which was great. <br />

      If I was to do something differently, I would like to step in early and
      give them feedback and not wait until the problem became worse.
