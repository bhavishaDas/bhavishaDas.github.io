			Identity, Values and Strengths
		</h1>
		<h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">
			Core Personal Values
		</h2>
		<p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
			One of my core values is work ethic and being honest to the work I
			undertake. I really don't appriciate when people don't follow up with
			their commitments. <br />

			When the lockdown started, we in the team knew that we will be made
			redundant soon. Before that though, we had a heap of bookings which were
			supposed to be cancelled. Being in sales, cancelled bookings meant losing
			on a heap of money along with the redundancy looming. <br />

			I had a to make a decision. It was either to sit at home and enjoy the
			wage subsidy knowing that I was close to loosing my job
			<strong>OR</strong> front up the harsh reality and get the work done<br />

			I chose the later and it felt right. Didn't make a change in my paycheck
			but I felt I had done the right thing. <br />

			I feel that this comes from growing up in a household where I have seen
			everyone hustle. I feel greatful to have grown up in an atomosphere where
			hardwork is recognised.

			Strengths and Limitations.
		</h2>
		<p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
			My strengths are that I have the ability to understand complex problems
			once I take a step back. I also have a good work ethic and my previous
			role as a Travel Consultant has conditioned me well for multimasking.
			Being in the sales industry, I have good communication skills and have
			extensive experience in managing stakeholder/client expectations. <br />
			I tend to get flustered and panicked when I am confronted with a problem
			which is hard to solve. I am aware that as a software developer, I will
			come across a zillion problems I won’t have an answer to. This course is
			actually helping me realise that if I take a step back, things fall into
			pieces. I also lack confidence - especially while I am doing this course.
			Self doubt creeps in from time to time which is a bummer.
			<br />
			I believe that my ability to perform in high pressure situations will help
			me in my journey in becoming a software developer. I do feel like I need
			to work on not getting flustered and breaking down the problem into
			smaller chunks and go step by step. I have started to use toggl more
			effectively now, regular breaks do help a lot. <br />
			Back in my previous role, I was working in a tight knit team and eveything
			was going great. One of my teammates got promoted to a team lead role. We
			all were super happy for them! With time, they started micro-managing
			everyone. All bookings needed their approval (which was never the case
			with the previous TL.) Five people in the team quit, it wasn't a good
			time. I had a 1:1 with them and highlighted what the issue was - they did
			acknowledge the problem which was refreshing. We started having regular
			catch-ups and they asked for constructive feedback. <br />

			Eventually things went back to normal which was great. <br />

			If I was to do something differently, I would like to step in early and
			give them feedback and not wait until the problem became worse.
