      Long term goal and or career pathway
    </h2>
    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
      I would like to grow in the software developer world. I have also been
      really intrigued by product management and might want to venture in that
      in the future. It all depends on how this course goes
    </p>
    <h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">Human Skills</h2>
    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
      I would like to gain public speaking skills. I get a bit flustered around
      larger groups of people especially if I don't know them. This skill is
      important to me because regardless of wherever I end up this skill will
      remain with me forever. It will also help me in my role as a software
      developer when it comes to explaining my tech designs to my team and allow
      me to be heard.
    </p>
    <h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">
      Strengths and Limitations
    </h2>
    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
      My strengths are that I have the ability to understand complex problems
      once I take a step back. I also have a good work ethic and my previous
      role as a Travel Consultant has conditioned me well for multimasking.
      Being in the sales industry, I have good communication skills and have
      extensive experience in managing stakeholder/client expectations. I tend
      to get flustered and panicked when I am confronted with a problem which is
      hard to solve. I am aware that as a software developer, I will come across
      a zillion problems I won’t have an answer to. This course is actually
      helping me realise that if I take a step back, things fall into pieces. I
      also lack confidence - especially while I am doing this course. Self doubt
      creeps in from time to time which is a bummer.
    </p>
    <h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">Workload Management</h2>
    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
      I’m aware I can get flustered when I get stuck on a problem and I intend
      to mitigate it by taking more short breaks and coming back to the problem.
      I’ve tired this previously and it seems to be working for me
    </p>
    <h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">Seeking Help</h2>
    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
      I’ll timebox my task and iIf i’m still having trouble figuring it out on
      my own with tools such as google I will either chat to one of my
      classmates or a facilitator for help.
    </p>
    <h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">Expectations</h2>
    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
      I expect guidance from my facilitator, I don’t necessarily want the answer
      just a push in the right direction and also honest constructive feedback
    </p>
    <h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">Scheduling Information</h2>
    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
      Not really, I’ve dedicated this time purley for Dev Academy.
