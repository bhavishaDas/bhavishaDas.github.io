			Long term goal and or career pathway
		</h2>
		<p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
			I would like to grow in the software developer world. I have also been
			really intrigued by product management and might want to venture in that
			in the future. It all depends on how this course goes
		</p>
		<h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">Human Skills</h2>
		<p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
			I would like to gain public speaking skills. I get a bit flustered around
			larger groups of people especially if I don't know them. This skill is
			important to me because regardless of wherever I end up this skill will
			remain with me forever. It will also help me in my role as a software
			developer when it comes to explaining my tech designs to my team and allow
			me to be heard.
		</p>
		<h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">
			Strengths and Limitations
		</h2>
		<p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
			My strengths are that I have the ability to understand complex problems
			once I take a step back. I also have a good work ethic and my previous
			role as a Travel Consultant has conditioned me well for multimasking.
			Being in the sales industry, I have good communication skills and have
			extensive experience in managing stakeholder/client expectations. I tend
			to get flustered and panicked when I am confronted with a problem which is
			hard to solve. I am aware that as a software developer, I will come across
			a zillion problems I won’t have an answer to. This course is actually
			helping me realise that if I take a step back, things fall into pieces. I
			also lack confidence - especially while I am doing this course. Self doubt
			creeps in from time to time which is a bummer.
		</p>
		<h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">Workload Management</h2>
		<p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
			I’m aware I can get flustered when I get stuck on a problem and I intend
			to mitigate it by taking more short breaks and coming back to the problem.
			I’ve tired this previously and it seems to be working for me
		</p>
		<h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">Seeking Help</h2>
		<p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
			I’ll timebox my task and iIf i’m still having trouble figuring it out on
			my own with tools such as google I will either chat to one of my
			classmates or a facilitator for help.
		</p>
		<h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">Expectations</h2>
		<p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
			I expect guidance from my facilitator, I don’t necessarily want the answer
			just a push in the right direction and also honest constructive feedback
		</p>
		<h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">Scheduling Information</h2>
		<p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 20px;">
			Not really, I’ve dedicated this time purley for Dev Academy.
