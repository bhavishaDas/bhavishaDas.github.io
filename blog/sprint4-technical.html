      A problem I got blocked on and a problem I solved elegantly
    </h1>
    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 25px;">
      The biggest block I had was in the super fizz buzz kata. I was having
      trouble understanding how to pass a function within a function. It took me
      awhile to research the right technique I finally found the solution from
      google and used the rubber ducky method to understand it. I learnt how to
      pass a function within a function which was useful in the following
      challenges.
      <br />
      I found that the “where are you” function was my most elegant solution
      while I was finding Scooby . The problem I had had was figuring out that
      the code needed to cater for cases when array.find returned undefined.
      This happened when Scooby was not found. Again I used Google to solve the
      problem but this time I knew what I was doing.

      Problem solving techniques
    </h1>
    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 25px;">
      <strong>Pseudocode</strong> <br />
      <br />
      I can see how Pseudocode is helpful when solving large problems but I
      didn’t find myself gravitating towards it much
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Trying something </strong> <br />
      <br />
      This technique is the one I found most useful as trying and failing is the
      best way to learn in my opinion
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Rubber ducky </strong> <br />
      <br />
      I thought I would find this silly but it’s actually really helpful and I
      found myself using this technique a lot
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Reading error messages </strong> <br />
      <br />
      I’m personally pretty bad at this and skip over it but I’m getting better
      slowly. Error messaged provide a lot of information that can make the
      debugging process quicker
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Console.log </strong> <br />
      <br />
      The best technique too debug for sure. Found myself using this a lot
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Googling </strong> <br />
      <br />
      This defiantly my go to technique. I’ve found stackoverflow and W3Schools
      are informative.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Asking peers/coaches for help </strong> <br />
      <br />
      I didn’t do this unfortunately, but i’ll try do this more from now onwards
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Improving process with reflection </strong> <br />
      <br />
      Self reflection is something I’m still working towards in terms of my
      technical work. I’ll make it a point to myself to be more aware of this
      next week
