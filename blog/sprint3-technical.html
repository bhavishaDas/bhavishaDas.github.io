    <h1 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">Differences HTML and CSS</h1>
    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 25px;">
      HTML provides structure to a website using tags such as 'header', 'div'
      and 'link'. However with just that alone your website would be pretty
      boring. Adding in CSS brings the colour and styling to the website. Add
      Javascrpit on top of that and that'll bring more interactivity to the
      website. Think of HTML as a black and white picture and CSS as the colour
      which when added to the picture makes it pretty.

    <h1 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">Control Flow and Loops</h1>

    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 25px;">
      Control flow is using If and Else statements in order to control the
      execution of the code. For example your crossing the road, 'if' the signal
      is red you stop and wait or 'else' the signal is green and you cross the
      road.
      <br />
      In programming, a loop is a piece of code that runs over and over again
      until a condition is met. For example every workday (Monday-Friday) you go
      to work until the weekend comes along.

    <h1 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">What is the DOM?</h1>

    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 25px;">
      The DOM is a programming interface that enables HTML and CSS to
      communicate with Javascript. The DOM is the most important piece as it
      provides you with thre missing link that ties these programmes together.

      Accessing data from Arrays vs Objects
    </h1>
    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 25px;">
      Both aarays and objects can be used to store data. Arrays store a
      collection of values whereas objects store data in key value pair.

    <h1 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">What are Functions?</h1>
    <p class="algin-center" style="font-size: 25px;">
      Functions are useful because it means you don't have to rewrite the same
      code multiple times. It allows you reuse a block of code anywhere by
      calling on the function.
