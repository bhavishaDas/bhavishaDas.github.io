  <h1> Positioning Properties in CSS</h1>
  <h2>Relative </h2>

  <p>
    Say if we have to move an element on the Web page, we can do so using something known as a position attribute.
    <br>
    In our example, we intend to move the element down by 50 pixels.

    <strong>Example</strong>: Attempting to move the element down without using the <strong>position</strong> property.
  <div>
    <img src="../img/without-relative.png" alt="screen shot" width="1200" height="400"> </img>
  </div>
  <br>
  As shown in the example above the element didn't move. To fix this, we will add a position property known as
  relative.This will move the element down by 50px as we intend to.
  <br> The key word relative moves the element relative to the position attribute, in this case 50px down - super
  confusing but yet makes sense

  <div>
    <img src="../img/withRelative.png" alt="screen shot" width="1200" height="400"> </img>
  </div>

  <h2> Absolute </h2>
  <p>
    If we want to position an element within another element (A div inside another div), we can use a property called
    absolute.

    This is an extemely powerful type of positioning that allows us to literally place any page element exactly where we
    want it using the positioning attributes top, left, bottom, and right.

    A massive <strong>Gotcha</strong> is that the positioning will be relative to the next parent. If there is no such
    parent, it will default all the way back up to the <html> element itself meaning it will be placed relative to the
    page itself.

    <br> Confused? Let's try to illustrate this concept using examples.
    The image below shows two divs, one nested (a child) within the other. In this case, we can use absolute which
    positions the element exactly where we want it to be

    <div>
      <img src="../img/absolute.png" alt="screen shot" width="1200" height="400"> </img>
    </div>

    What happens if these divs are not nested? Lets have a look<br>

    <div>
      <img src="../img/without-abs.png" alt="screen shot" width="1200" height="400"> </img>
    </div>

    So what happened here? Remember we mentioned that for absolute to work, the positioning will be relevant to its
    parent. Since this div does not have a parent, it will be placed relative to the
    page itself.

    <h2>Fixed </h2>
    A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport (viewing area of the web page). The viewport doesn’t
    change when the window is scrolled, so a fixed positioned element will stay right where it is when the page is
    scrolled.

    This can come in handy if say we want to implement a nav bar and we want it to be visible regardless of the page scroll position.

    Images below shows how the fixed property changes the position on the element.

    When Fixed is applied 
    <br>
    <div>
      <img src="../img/fixed.png" alt="screen shot" width="1200" height="400"> </img>
    </div>
    When Fixed is not applied 
    <br>
    <div>
      <img src="../img/notfixed.png" alt="screen shot" width="1200" height="400"> </img>
    </div>
    
</body>
