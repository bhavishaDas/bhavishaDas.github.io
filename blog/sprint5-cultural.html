      Three things I learnt about myself and my ego
    </h2>
    <p class="google-fonts-playball algin-center" style="font-size: 25px;">
      At the start of the course I found myself getting flustered and panicing
      alot if I didn't know the answer but I've learnt that it's okay to not
      always know what the solution is.
      <br />
      The other thing i've learnt is that I have always had a growth mindset -
      reading into growth mindset helped me connect the dots.
      <br />
      Another important breakthrough for me was to realise that it's ok to ask
      for help and everyone is in the same boat.
      <br />

      Role of values, empathy and self awareness
    </h2>

    <p>
      Values, empathy and self awareness is vital in learning and programming.
      For instance, if you are helping someone - it is important to show
      kindness and compassion. Being self aware helps you grow in the area which
      you might not be good at. Knowing your weakness helps you level up each
      day every day.

      What surprised me about core learning
    </h2>
    <p>
      The important part it plays in learning and writing code
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">
      Most challenging aspects of the core learning
    </h2>
    <p>
      The hardest part about core learning is that Iâ€™m usually not an emotional
      person so it defiantly made me more aware of people feelings and thoughts
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">
      Why we're spending time on core learning in a web development course?
    </h2>
    <p>
      It's so we understand and are able to speak to others in a respectful way
      as you'll most likely be working in a team where communication is
      important daily.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">
      Is core learning a waste of time?
    </h2>
    <p>
      No I don't think it's a waste of time as I mentioned above I think it's
      important to be able to communicate
    </p>

      My long term goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      Contributing in delivering quality software in any capacity (Hopefully
      still coding)
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">
      Biggest strengths and limitations in Bootcamp
    </h2>
    <p>
      My biggest strength would be my ability to learn from my peers and
      mentors. My limitation would be seeing others understand something faster
      than me - I need to condition my mind to be ok with it.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">
      Biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
    </h2>
    <p>
      Staying motivated and keeping self belief when I struggle to understand a
      concept
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="google-fonts-playball algin-center">
      Non-technical skills I would like to see developed at EDA
    </h2>
    <p>
      I would to imporve my soft skills at EDA. Speaking in front on a group,
      giving feedback etc.
    </p>

      Expectations of myself at Bootcamp
